Hi! Watch me figure out what makes the Netflix brand unique from all the other streaming services.

This is part 2 of 2 of a capstone project for Google's Data Analysis program on Coursera where I learned about the average journey of data--from finding the right problems all the way to presenting it.

Throughout the course, I learned about tools like SQL, RStudio, Google Sheets/Microsoft Excel, and Tableau, but it was during this project where most that learning kicked in because I got to use them all.

To read all about it, this is the order I recommend for going through the files:

1. **Case Study 2 Brief** this is the primer to the project, but a little different this time because I was responsible for everything now, from finding the problem, the right data, and the solutions.
2. **Netflix RStudio Data Analysis Journal:** this was a documentation of all the data work I did on RStudio, from cleaning & preparing the data to analyzing it.
3. **Netflix Case Study Presentation:** the "coup de grace" aka final piece to the project: the presentation! this was where I synthesized the analysis with my recommendations in one neat slideshow.
If you had to look at _**one thing**__, I would look at this.

I'd appreciate any feedback, and hope you enjoy as much as I did!
